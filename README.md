ttrss-comics
============

[Tiny Tiny RSS](http://www.tt-rss.org) plugins to fix comics' feeds. Enabling the plugins will add **inline images** to supported feeds. 

Currently available:
 * [GU Comics](http://www.gucomics.com/)
 * [Married to the sea](http://www.marriedtothesea.com/)
 * [Toothpaste for dinner](http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/)

These plugins should work on any reasonably recent version of tt-rss and were last tested on tt-rrs 1.7.9.
Note that the plugins will not have to connect to the webpage of the comic, they merely construct the url for the image from information already available in the respective feeds.

## Installation

 * Unpack the [zip-File](https://github.com/tribut/ttrss-comics/archive/master.zip)
 * Move the respective folder (af_*) to your plugins directory
 * Enable plugins in TT-RSS's Preferences -> Plugins

Please report any problems you might encounter using github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/tribut/ttrss-comics/issues).
